# TodoEr

### Project Overview

This project is a simple task management application built with React and Redux, utilizing Vite as the build tool. It allows users to add, update, complete, and delete tasks, providing a clean and interactive user interface. The application leverages Redux for state management, ensuring that the state of the task list is efficiently handled and updated across components.

### Key Features

- **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks they no longer need.
- **State Management**: The application uses Redux Toolkit for managing the state of the tasks and the visibility of delete confirmation messages.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and modern design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the local storage, allowing users to retain their task list even after refreshing the page.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing the application state.
- **Vite**: As the development server and build tool, offering fast refresh and optimized builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.
